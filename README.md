# file-orgeniser-python

This the project where I wrote a script to automatically arrange files based on their month and year, and save them in a super folder for safekeeping. The script arranges the items according to the month and year inside the respective year folder.

During the project, I discovered that #python 3.10 introduced 'match case' statements, which are similar to 'switch case' statements. I used these statements and found out that they don't require break statements.

I got the idea for this project from a YouTube video from Alex Hyett and some extensions but he did it for Photos only and I add some more extensions such as jpg, jpeg, png, mov, mp4, mp3, txt, docx, rar, pdf. Some file extensions are not added yet, but you can add them to this project by editing the code.
Thank you.
